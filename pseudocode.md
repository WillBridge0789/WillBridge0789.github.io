# Contact Card
### Purpose
* To use Bootstrap grid/wireframe to design a mock contact card. 
### Functionality
* None so far. Could be a future goal.
### Start
1. Making a html file with: 
    * Links to CSS 
    * Proper CDN links to Bootstrap
>We are **ONLY** using **Bootstrap** for this.
2. Read through Bootstrap Documentation to find features to use that can help
    * Containers, rows, columns, etc.
    * **HINT** Card wrapper as well
3. Make an "img" directory to put images provided in.
4. Use a little CSS to help personalize
5. Done?
