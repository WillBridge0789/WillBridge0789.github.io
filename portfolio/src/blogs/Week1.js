                    <p className="card-text">No it wasn't. When I started this I was thinking I was going to get hit with a Titanic load of material the 1st 2 days and be expected to learn it in 3 snaps. My anxiety clocked in on time.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">JavaScript and Python. Back in 2015-2016 I played a little bit with JavaScript and Python (More Python than JavaScript) so I'll be excited to try to understand those 2 languages a bit better.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">I'm timid and reserved most times but I'm also a GOOFBALL. Laughing is a thing I enjoy a lot. Comedy is also my favorite genre. Being normal is overrated sometimes.</p>
