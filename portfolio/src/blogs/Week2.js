                    <h5 className="card-title">1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">It's very intriguing and still somewhat confusing on how these 3 languages dance together to do what they do.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">2. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">I was intimidated with it at first because of how important it is. Im not a good writer, but now knowing that I'm writing it to where I can understand the code and writing it to help myself organize the code can only benefit me in the long run. It became less initimidating after that realization.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">3. What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">Honestly being able to take breaks when I started to feel overwhelmed and instructor encouragement.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">4. What hindered your progress during Onboarding?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">Reading and trying to understand the documentation. The reading ends up taking me almost 15-25 minutes to get through one section and have a hope that I understand the gist. Only to get to a practice or a project that we have to do and be nearly completely stumped.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">5. How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">I keep telling myself "You dont know what you dont know", "Do what you can", and "You got this". Reassuing myself only does so much but I keep repeating those things to myself, BREATHE, and then reread what Ive read before.</p>
