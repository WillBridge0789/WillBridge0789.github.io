# Will's Blog

### 1. **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**
No it wasn't. When I started this I was thinking I was going to get hit with a Titanic load of material the 1st 2 days and be expected to learn it in 3 snaps. My anxiety clocked in on time.

### 2. **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?** 
JavaScript and Python. Back in 2015-2016 I played a little bit with JavaScript and Python (More Python than JavaScript) so I'll be excited to try to understand those 2 languages a bit better.

### 3. **What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?**
I'm timid and reserved most times but I'm also a GOOFBALL. Laughing is a thing I enjoy a lot. Comedy is also my favorite genre. Being normal is overrated sometimes.

# Onboard Sprint 2: After Demo Day

### 1. **What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?**
It's very intriguing and still somewhat confusing on how these 3 languages dance together to do what they do. 

### 2. **What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?**
I was intimidated with it at first because of how important it is. Im not a good writer, but now knowing that I'm writing it to where I can understand the code and writing it to help myself organize the code can only benefit me in the long run. It became less initimidating after that realization.

### 3. **What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?**
Honestly being able to take breaks when I started to feel overwhelmed and instructor encouragement.

### 4. **What hindered your progress during Onboarding?**
Reading and trying to understand the documentation. The reading ends up taking me almost 15-25 minutes to get through one section and have a hope that I understand the gist. Only to get to a practice or a project that we have to do and be nearly completely stumped.

### 5. **How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?**
I keep telling myself "You dont know what you dont know", "Do what you can", and "You got this". Reassuing myself only does so much but I keep repeating those things to myself, BREATHE, and then reread what Ive read before. 

# Sprint 1

### 1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
Maybe I'm holding myself back. When I am working on things, sometimes I worry about my surroundings which tend to take my attention off of what I need to do. I live with 2 other people after all. One of them being my partner. 

### 2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
 1. I want to understand and learn functions and about structuring the data types correctly.<br>
 **AND**
 2. Get a more solidified foundation on bootstrap frameworks and its principles   

### 3. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
I feel like in-person bootcamp would make classmates and work a bit more engaging compared to remote.

### 4. What is your “Why”?
In the past, I've always put people before myself. One of the main reasons "why" is because I'm doing this for MYSELF for once. My partner and the kid comes second. He knows, understands and fully supports me while doing this. I am going to try my hardest not to let myself down...and I wont let him and the kid down either.

# Sprint 2
### 1. What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
What helped me was going back to reread some of the resources and documentation given to me. It a great deal; especially with this weeks project.

### 2. What does it mean to develop good code?
I'm going to guess and say its coding dynamically. I cant elaborate more on that currently, but thats the first thing I thought.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good developer?
Organizing and cleaning up code, making everything readable and leaving comments to explain what block of code is doing what.

### 4. What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
I would think micromanaging and maybe BEING micromanaged. 

# Sprint 6 
### 1. Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
I think they are a little bit easier because you dont have to type nearly as much as you would with just vanilla JS.

### 2. What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
I would like to learn more on React to get a better grasp of the concepts. Another one I am curious about is Django.

### 3. Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
I'm not for sure yet. (answer will change when I come up with it).
