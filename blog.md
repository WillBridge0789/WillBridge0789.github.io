# Will's Blog

## 1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
No it wasn't. When I started this I was thinking I was going to get hit with a Titanic load of material the 1st 2 days and be expected to learn it in 3 snaps. My anxiety clocked in on time.

## 2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about? 
JavaScript and Python. Back in 2015-2016 I played a little bit with JavaScript and Python (More Python than JavaScript) so I'll be excited to try to understand those 2 languages a bit better.

## 3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
I'm timid and reserved most times but I'm also a GOOFBALL. Laughing is a thing I enjoy a lot. Comedy is also my favorite genre.
