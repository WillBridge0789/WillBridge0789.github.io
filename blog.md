# Will's Blog

### 1. **Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**
No it wasn't. When I started this I was thinking I was going to get hit with a Titanic load of material the 1st 2 days and be expected to learn it in 3 snaps. My anxiety clocked in on time.

### 2. **What are you excited or eager to learn more about?** 
JavaScript and Python. Back in 2015-2016 I played a little bit with JavaScript and Python (More Python than JavaScript) so I'll be excited to try to understand those 2 languages a bit better.

### 3. **What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?**
I'm timid and reserved most times but I'm also a GOOFBALL. Laughing is a thing I enjoy a lot. Comedy is also my favorite genre. Being normal is overrated sometimes.

# Onboard Sprint 2: After Demo Day

### 1. **What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?**
It's very intriguing and still somewhat confusing on how these 3 languages dance together to do what they do. 

### 2. **What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?**
I was intimidated with it at first because of how important it is. Im not a good writer, but now knowing that I'm writing it to where I can understand the code and writing it to help myself organize the code can only benefit me in the long run. It became less initimidating after that realization.

### 3. **What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?**
Honestly being able to take breaks when I started to feel overwhelmed and instructor encouragement.

### 4. **What hindered your progress during Onboarding?**
Reading and trying to understand the documentation. The reading ends up taking me almost 15-25 minutes to get through one section and have a hope that I understand the gist. Only to get to a practice or a project that we have to do and be nearly completely stumped.

### 5. **How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?**
I keep telling myself "You dont know what you dont know", "Do what you can", and "You got this". Reassuing myself only does so much but I keep repeating those things to myself, BREATHE, and then reread what Ive read before. 

# Sprint 1

### 1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
Maybe I'm holding myself back. When I am working on things, sometimes I worry about my surroundings which tend to take my attention off of what I need to do. I live with 2 other people after all. One of them being my partner. 

### 2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
 1. I want to understand and learn functions and about structuring the data types correctly.<br>
 **AND**
 2. Get a more solidified foundation on bootstrap frameworks and its principles   

### 3. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
I feel like in-person bootcamp would make classmates and work a bit more engaging compared to remote.

### 4. What is your “Why”?
In the past, I've always put people before myself. One of the main reasons "why" is because I'm doing this for MYSELF for once. My partner and the kid comes second. He knows, understands and fully supports me while doing this. I am going to try my hardest not to let myself down...and I wont let him and the kid down either.

# Sprint 2
### 1. What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
What helped me was going back to reread some of the resources and documentation given to me. It a great deal; especially with this weeks project.

### 2. What does it mean to develop good code?
I'm going to guess and say its coding dynamically. I cant elaborate more on that currently, but thats the first thing I thought.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good developer?
Organizing and cleaning up code, making everything readable and leaving comments to explain what block of code is doing what.

### 4. What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
I would think micromanaging and maybe BEING micromanaged. 

# Sprint 5
### 1. What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
Ive learned they are very case and spelling sensitive and they can be scary if you've typed something and start seeing a large block of RED.
### 2. If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
I haven't thought about that....maybe make a command that would add, commit and push all at once. (There is probably one like that already)
### 3. List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code
A web page in general? I would think any web page at this point would take a bit of planning in order for it to work.

# Sprint 6 
### 1. Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
I think they are a little bit easier because you dont have to type nearly as much as you would with just vanilla JS.

### 2. What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
I would like to learn more on React to get a better grasp of the concepts. Another one I am curious about is Django.

### 3. Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
I'm not for sure yet. (answer will change when I come up with it).

## Sprint 7
### 1. Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?
Can't answer the first but for the second, Just being able to have a better understanding on how these languages work together and to use them more dynamically and efficiently.

### 2. Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?
They may have changed. I'm not entirely for sure yet where I'm focusing on the present more than whats ahead.

### 3. What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript? 
How much I remembered from when I first studied Python 7 years ago. Most of what I learned from the past came back and helped me get through some challenges.

## Sprint 8
### 1. What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?
They both have some methods that actually do the same things. The syntax between the 2 is very noticable with the lack of semi-colons, brackets and sometimes curly brackets.

### 2. If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?
I'm not for sure. JS is loosly typed where Python is a lot more strict with syntax. I think just on the aformentioned point, that would make it a little easier. That is just my guess though.

### 3. Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future? 
I kind of do when reading it. Structuring is still my achelles heel here, but I feel like I could enjoy working with it and building a unique database.
